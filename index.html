  <h3>Career</h3>
  <p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I have the determination to make it. I'm going to graduate with a good GPA.
    My goal is to make it into UC Berkeley so I can study chemical engineering. Recently, I have been looking into
    engineering and I find it interesting.
    My plan for this goal is to first, do well in high school and graduate with a high GPA. The second step is to try to
    get into UC Berkeley, because it offers the major I want.
    Third, if I do graduate from college with a degree in chemical engineering I will look for a job where I can use the
    knowledge and skills I have from studying this.
    The reason I picked this out of anything is simply because I have a passion for engineering and know the basics of
    it.
    And why I picked chemical engineering is because I find it interesting wokring with chemicals and I would really
    enjoy taking chemistry.
    <br /><br />
    Some skills I believe I have that woud be great for this career choice is that I make executive decisions. Most of
    the time I work on a school project I usually make the hard decision I think are the correct ones.
    Another skill I think would be helpful is that I take big projects very seriously which incorperates itself into the
    job because a main component in this career is developing projects.
    The last skill is that I am open-minded, which means that I will consider everyones opinions. I know I have this
    skill because I always take others opinions into consideration.
    <br /><br />
    I used to be a part of a golf club, however I have learned over time that sports is not really my thing. I have
    participated in more sports after that, but I am not going any where with them.
    In school it's a different story, I try to do well in school and I now know that I put a lot of effort into my work
    to try and get a good score.
    This made me start to realize that I have skills that allow me to be a hard-worker and focus on tasks at hand. With
    all of these skills I know that I can be good at a job that I study for and become.
    In high school, I am taking part in a Electronics and Palentology club which seem very intriguing and I look forward
    to it.
    But what really has shaped me into being a hard-worker is an award I got from a teacher of academic achievement.
    This is really thoughtful to me because it shapes me into the person I am today.
    <br /><br />
    In conclusion, I included my career interests after high school, my goals/achievements and some skills that I have that are pretty cool.
    I wanted to thank you for taking the time to read more about me that you probably didn't know before. I hope you enjoyed it.
